# D3.js USA - A Front-end Map Renderer

## Overview
An interactive map that takes user input (of US cities), and renders a SVG map using D3.js library and svg-pan-zoom.

## Flow
`components/homepage.js` is the parent component, and handles the input functionality and renders the input box along with the child component, USMap, passing cities as a prop.
